"""The live (active) credential store for OpenAI Codex CLI accounts.

Codex keeps its login in one of two places, chosen by
``cli_auth_credentials_store`` in ``$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`` (default
``"file"``; codex-rs/config/src/types.rs:112-125):

- ``file``: ``$CODEX_HOME/auth.json``.
- ``keyring``: the OS keyring only — on macOS the generic-password item
  service ``"Codex Auth"``, account ``"cli|" + sha256(canonical home)[:16]``,
  value the compact JSON of the same document. A successful save deletes
  ``auth.json`` (codex-rs/login/src/auth/storage.rs:235-322).
- ``auto``: keyring first, file on a miss or a keyring error; saves go to the
  keyring and fall back to the file (storage.rs:431-457).

``ephemeral`` (memory only) cannot be switched from outside the process, and
the keyring modes are only implemented for the macOS Keychain; both raise
:class:`CodexStoreUnsupported`.

:class:`CodexCredentialStore` overrides only the ACTIVE half of
``CredentialStore`` — ``_read_active_credentials`` and ``_write_credentials``
(``_read_credentials`` and the whole per-slot backup half are inherited, the
backup Keychain service coming from the host's ``backup_keychain_service``).
The Claude-specific active methods (managed key, ``.credentials.json``,
residual-item pinning) become unreachable.

    KEYCHAIN ROUTING. The base class learns per-process Keychain usability
    from real ops (``_kc_call``) and routes on it (``_use_keychain``); the

    straight to the ``macos_keychain`` wrappers instead, in every mode:

    - The store is dictated by Codex's config, not by what we learned. Gating

      a keyring-mode Codex reads.
    - A failure on the ``Codex Auth`` item is reported precisely where the
      switcher consumes it — this read's ``ActiveCredentials`` verdict — and
      the backup half learns usability from its own first op, so flipping the
      shared cache would add nothing but cross-talk: a later success on the
      Codex item would erase a failure ``_kc_call`` recorded for a backup
      read (the erasure ``_active_read_failed`` exists to prevent).
